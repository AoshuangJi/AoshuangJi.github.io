## Research interest

Atmosphere evolution; Planetary science; Astrobiology; Climate modeling; Paleoclimate

The overarching of my work is to understand the evolution of Earth's atmosphere billion years ago. Specifically, how oxygen, ozone, methane evolved through time and how these gases interacted in the atmosphere and shaped our Earth's atmosphere. I mainly use 1-D photochemical model, and have also constructed a biogeochemical box model for the atmosphere-ocean system.
